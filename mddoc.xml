A simple, directed phpDoc => Markdown generator.

This is a work in progress and not ready for use.

This projects goal is to be able to define a set of directions for *how* to document a set of PHP files as well as markdown and other text to include, and output the final documentation in a jekyll or other markdown site builder ready form.
