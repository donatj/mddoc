A simple, directed phpDoc => Markdown generator.

This is a work in progress and not ready for use.

This projects goal is to be able to define a set of directions for *how* to document a set of PHP files as well as markdown and other text to include, and output the final documentation in a jekyll or other markdown site builder ready form.


## Requirements

- **php**: >=7.2
- **ext-dom**: *
- **ext-json**: *
- **donatj/flags**: ~1.4
- **donatj/cli-toolkit**: ~0.2
- **donatj/mddom**: ~0.1.0
- **phpdocumentor/reflection**: ~4.0
